                <p>

                    <br>
                    Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.
                    Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Moon. It is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.
                    Mercury's surface temperature varies greatly, ranging from extremely hot during the day to extremely cold at night due to its lack of atmosphere.
                    Despite being closest to the Sun, it is not the hottest planet in the Solar System; that title goes to Venus due to its thick, heat-trapping atmosphere.
                    Mercury quickly rotates on its axis, completing a rotation every 59 Earth days, which means a day on Mercury is longer than its year.

                    Mercury is one of the least explored planets in our solar system, 
                    and understanding it can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets, 
                    including Earth. NASA's MESSENGER mission has greatly expanded our knowledge of Mercury, 
                    revealing its complex geology and history.
