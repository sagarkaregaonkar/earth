                <h2>About Earth</h2>
                  <p>
                  Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere.
                  It is the only planet in our solar system that has liquid water on its surface, which is essential for life as we know it.
                  Earth has a diverse range of ecosystems, climates, and landscapes, from lush forests to arid deserts, and from towering mountains to vast oceans.
                  The planet's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases, which support life
                  and protect us from harmful solar radiation.
                  Earth has a rich history, with evidence of human civilization dating back thousands of years.

                <h2>Distance from Earth</h2>
                <p>The distance between Earth and other planets varies depending on their orbits. For example, the distance to Mars can be as close as 54.6 million kilometers.</p>
