                <h2>About Mars</h2>
                <p>
                    Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".
                    The reddish appearance of Mars is due to iron oxide, commonly known as rust, on its surface.
                    Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon. It has surface features both similar to both the Moon and Earth, including the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and a canyon system, Valles Marineris, that dwarfs the Grand Canyon.
                    Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured
                    asteroids. The planet has been a target for exploration by numerous spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, with the goal of understanding its geology, climate, and potential for past or present life.

                <h2>Nearest Planets</h2>
                <p>Earth and Jupiter are Mars's nearest planetary neighbors.</p>
                <h2>Distance from Earth</h2>
                <p>The distance between Mars and Earth ranges from 54.6 million to 401 million kilometers.</p>

            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mars has the largest dust storms in the Solar System, which can cover the entire planet.</li>
                <li>The Martian day is only slightly longer than an Earth day, lasting about 24.6 hours.</li>
                <li>Mars has seasons like Earth due to its axial tilt, but they last about twice as long.</li>
                <li>Water ice exists at the polar ice caps of Mars, and there is evidence of liquid water in the past.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Why Do We Go to Mars?</h1>
            <p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, 
                and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to explore the alien landscape. 
                NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, 
                with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.
