                <h2>About Saturn</h2>
                <p>
                    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
                    It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. 
                    It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, 
                    Saturn is over 95 times more massive.
                    Saturn is best known for its stunning ring system, which is made up of ice and rock particles that range in size from tiny grains to large boulders.
                    The rings are divided into several main sections, with the largest being the A, B, and C rings. 
                    Saturn has at least 82 moons, with Titan being the largest and most well-known. Titan is larger than the planet Mercury and has a thick atmosphere, making it unique
                    among moons in the Solar System.
                    Saturn has a very low density, which means it could float in water if there were a body of water large enough to hold it. 
                    The planet has a very strong magnetic field and is surrounded by a complex system of magnetic fields and radiation belts.
                    Saturn's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with traces of other gases such as methane and ammonia. 
                    The planet has a banded appearance similar to Jupiter, with bands of clouds that move at different speeds.
                    Saturn has a very long day, taking about 10.7 hours to complete one rotation on its axis.

                <h2>Rings of Saturn</h2>
                <p>Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, 
                    or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, 
                    torn apart by Saturn's powerful gravity. 
                    They are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rock coated with other materials such as dust. 
                    The ring particles mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house. 
                    A few particles are as large as mountains. 
                    The rings would look mostly white if you looked at them from the cloud tops of Saturn, and interestingly, each ring orbits at a different speed around the planet.

Saturn's ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical height is typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main rings. Named alphabetically in the order they were discovered, the rings are relatively close to each other, with the exception of a gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width called the Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B. The main rings are A, B, and C. Rings D, E, F, and G are fainter and more recently discovered.</p>
                <h2>Nearest Planets</h2>
                <p>Jupiter and Uranus are Saturn's nearest planetary neighbors.</p>
                <h2>Distance from Earth</h2>
                <p>The distance between Saturn and Earth ranges from 1.2 billion to 1.7 billion kilometers.</p>
