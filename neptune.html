                <h2>About Neptune</h2>
                <p>
                    Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
                    Neptune is primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it a striking blue color. It has a very dynamic atmosphere with the fastest winds in the Solar System, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 miles per hour).
                    Neptune has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most interesting. Triton is unique because it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet
                    (a retrograde orbit), suggesting that it may have been captured by Neptune's gravity rather than forming in place.
                    Neptune was discovered in 1846, and it was the first planet located through mathematical predictions rather than direct observation. Its discovery was a significant milestone in the history of astronomy, demonstrating the power
                    of mathematical calculations in predicting the existence of celestial bodies.
