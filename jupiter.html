                <h2>About Jupiter</h2>
                <p>
                    Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. 
                    It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.
                    Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and other compounds.
                    It has a very strong magnetic field and is known for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been raging for at least 350 years.
                    Jupiter has a total of 79 known moons, with the four largest being Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, known as the Galilean moons.
                    These moons are of great interest to scientists, particularly Europa, which is believed to have a subsurface ocean that may harbor life.

                <h2>Nearest Planets</h2>
                <p>Mars and Saturn are Jupiter's nearest planetary neighbors.</p>
                <h2>How many Moons?</h2>
                <p> With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system.
                   Jupiter has 95 moons that are officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union. The four largest moons  Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope. These four moons are known today as the Galilean satellites,
                   and they're some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar system.</p>
                <h2>Distance from Earth</h2>
                <p>The distance between Jupiter and Earth ranges from 588 million to 968 million kilometers.</p>

    <p style=" justify-content:center ;font-size: 18px; color: greenyellow; padding: 10px;">Jupiter's position in the Solar System relative to Earth and the Sun.</p>
    <p style="justify-content: center; padding: 10px;">
    With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.
    From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), 
    Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun. 
    One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. 
    From this distance, it takes sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.
