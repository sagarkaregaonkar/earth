                <h2>About Venus</h2>
                <p>
                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, 
                    visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.
                    Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, but it has a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. The surface temperature on Venus can reach up to 465 degrees Celsius (869 degrees Fahrenheit).
                    The planet has a rocky body and is covered with volcanoes, mountains, and vast plains.
                    Venus has no moons or rings, and it rotates on its axis very slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. Interestingly, a day on Venus (one rotation) is longer than a year on Venus (one orbit around the Sun), which takes about 225 Earth days.
                    The atmosphere of Venus is composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid,
                    making it highly acidic and inhospitable to life as we know it. The atmospheric pressure
                    on Venus is about 92 times that of Earth, equivalent to being nearly a kilometer underwater
                    on Earth.
                    Despite its harsh conditions, Venus has been a target for exploration by various space missions, including NASA's Magellan spacecraft, which mapped the planet's surface using radar.
                    Venus is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to their similar size and
                    composition, but the extreme conditions on Venus make it a very different world from Earth.

                <h2>Nearest Planets</h2>
                <p>Earth and Mercury are Venus's nearest planetary neighbors.</p>
                <h2>Distance from Earth</h2>
                <p>The distance between Venus and Earth ranges from 38 million to 261 million kilometers.</p>
