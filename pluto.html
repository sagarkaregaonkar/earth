                <h2>About Pluto</h2>
                <p>
                    Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. 
                    It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered. 
                    After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun.
                    However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union redefined the criteria for planethood, and Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.
                    Pluto has a highly elliptical orbit that takes it from 4.28 billion kilometers (2.66 billion miles) to 7.5 billion kilometers (4.67 billion miles) from the Sun.
                    It has a diameter of about 2,377 kilometers (1,477 miles), making it smaller than Earth's Moon.
                    Pluto has five known moons, with Charon being the largest and closest to Pluto. 
                    Charon is so large relative to Pluto that they are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system.
                    Pluto's surface is primarily composed of ice and rock, and it has a thin atmosphere that expands when it is closer to the Sun and collapses when it is farther away.
                    The New Horizons spacecraft made a historic flyby of Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up images and data about the dwarf planet and its moons.
                    The mission revealed a complex and varied surface with mountains, valleys, and possible cryovolcanoes, indicating that Pluto is geologically active.

                <h2>Pluto and its Fellow Dwarf Planets</h2>
                <p>Pluto is one of five officially recognized dwarf planets in our solar system, along with Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres. 
                    These celestial bodies share certain characteristics, 
                    such as being unable to clear their orbits of other debris and having a spherical shape. 
                    The study of these dwarf planets helps scientists understand the diversity and complexity of our solar system.</p>
                <h2>Nearest Planets</h2>
                <p>Neptune is Pluto's nearest planetary neighbor.</p>
                <h2>Distance from Earth</h2>
                <p>The distance between Pluto and Earth ranges from 4.28 billion to 7.5 billion kilometers.</p>
