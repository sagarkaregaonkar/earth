                <h2>About Uranus</h2>
                <p>
                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.
                    Uranus is unique among the planets in the Solar System because it rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of about 98 degrees. This means that its poles are almost in the plane of its orbit, resulting in extreme seasonal variations.
                    The planet has a faint ring system and 27 known moons, with Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda being the largest. These moons are of great interest to
                    scientists, particularly Miranda, which has a highly varied and complex surface that suggests a history of geological activity.
                    Uranus is  the coldest planet in the Solar System. Its atmosphere is primarily
                    composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it a blue-green color.
                    Uranus was discovered in 1781 by Sir William Herschel, and it was the first planet discovered with a telescope. Its discovery expanded our understanding of the Solar System and demonstrated that there
                    were more planets beyond Saturn.
